On the Heroes’ Square in front of the Hofburg stand two imposing equestrian statues. One of them depicts **Prince Eugene of Savoy**, a man whose life was as extraordinary as the dynasty from which he came. Celebrated as one of the most brilliant military leaders of the Habsburg Monarchy, Eugene was also the creator of Vienna’s Belvedere Palace, today a magnet for visitors from around the world eager to see Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss.

He was born in Paris in 1663 into the House of Savoy. His mother, Olympia Mancini, belonged to the influential Italian-French Mancini family and was the niece of Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the powerful chief minister of France. Determined to strengthen his political position, Mazarin brought his nieces—known at court as the Mazarinettes—to Paris and arranged prestigious marriages for them. The eldest, Marie Mancini, was famous for her romance with King Louis XIV. Her sister, Anne-Marie Mancini, married Michał Wiśniowiecki, King of Poland, in 1665. Olympia married Prince Eugene Maurice of Savoy-Carignano, linking the Savoyard bloodline with French high society.

Mazarin’s death in 1661 marked the beginning of a decline in the family’s fortunes. Olympia’s standing at the court of Louis XIV suffered a devastating blow when she became embroiled in the notorious “Affair of the Poisons,” a scandal involving poisonings, witchcraft, and political intrigue that shocked the French aristocracy in the 1670s. Though never convicted, she was widely suspected of complicity and was exiled from France in 1679. The disgrace ruined her reputation and left her young son without vital political support.

From an early age, Eugene was determined to pursue a military career, but the French king—possibly influenced by his family’s tarnished reputation—rejected his request for a commission. In 1683, Eugene left France for Vienna, arriving at a critical moment as the Habsburg Monarchy prepared to face the Ottoman siege. He quickly entered imperial service, distinguished himself on the battlefield, and rose through the ranks with remarkable speed.

Over the next decades, Eugene played a central role in shaping European politics and warfare. His campaigns against the Ottomans, the French, and other adversaries cemented his reputation as one of the great commanders of his age. As President of the Imperial War Council, he directed Habsburg military policy for much of the early 18th century. His wealth and influence allowed him to commission grand architectural projects, most notably the Belvedere Palace—a masterpiece of Baroque design symbolising both his personal glory and the power of the Habsburg Empire.

When Eugene died in Vienna in 1736, he left behind not only a military legacy that had altered the balance of power in Europe but also a cultural heritage that continues to shape the city’s identity. In addition to the Belvedere, Vienna is home to his Winter Palace (Winterpalais Prinz Eugen), while just 40 kilometres outside the city stands the monumental Schloss Hof, his splendid countryside estate. He is also well known in popular culture, particularly through the traditional song "Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter" ("Prinz Eugene, the noble knight"), which celebrates his 1717 victory at the Battle of Belgrade.
