From 7 May to 18 October 2025, Luxembourg City hosts **LUGA – Luxembourg Urban Garden**, a six-month-long open-air exhibition.  Spread across five key sites (including three in the heart of the capital) LUGA invites visitors to *render the invisible visible* by rethinking the relationship between city, nature, and society. The three main locations in the capital **Pétrusse Valley**, **Alzette Valley**, and the **Municipal Park** form a symbolic green loop around the old city, occupying the very spaces once shaped by Luxembourg’s military fortifications and river gorges.

### The Edouard André Municipal Park  
At the top of the city, the **Municipal Park** spans over 30 hectares and was originally designed by French landscape architect Édouard André in the 19th century on the very grounds where fortress walls once stood. For LUGA, the park becomes a realm of discovery, offering art installations, bioluminescent plants, narrative trails, and gardens that explore the relationship between nature and imagination. 

### The Pétrusse Valley  
Descending from the Municipal Park, the **Pétrusse Valley** extends along the riverbed at the foot of the fortress plateau. Recently rewilded and landscaped, it now offers green slopes, skate parks, and trails along the river. LUGA transforms this area with installations by young designers, showcasing urban gardens that address climate change, biodiversity, and the role of public space.

From the Pétrusse valley you can access 900 meter Aquatunnel connecting Pétrusse to Pfaffenthal. Originally built for wastewater and later used for civil protection, this underground artery becomes a resonating space of sound with an sound by Scottish artist Susan Philipsz.

### The Alzette Valley  
To the east, the **Alzette Valley** opens a different chapter—this time with an emphasis on heritage and ecology. Once a center of horticulture and home to the brewing and textile industries, this valley is now a mosaic of riverbanks, gardens, and historical remnants.
