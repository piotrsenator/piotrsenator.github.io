The Würstelstand is a true Viennese institution. These humble sausage stands are such a vital part of the city’s culture that they have recently been added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage. While some worry that they may be edged out by newer, trendier street food like kebab stalls, Würstelstände remain a beloved and unmistakable part of Vienna’s urban landscape.

## What is a Würstelstand?

As the name suggests, it is where you go to get a Wurst (a sausage). And not just any sausage. The variety is impressive, each with its own following:

- **Käsekrainer**: the undisputed emperor of Viennese sausages, a grilled sausage stuffed with pockets of molten cheese. It sizzles and sometimes oozes in unexpected ways, which is why locals jokingly call it things like *Eitrige* (meaning "pus-filled").

- **Frankfurter**: the lightest option, similar to what the world knows as “hot dogs.”

- **Bratwurst**: grilled, juicy, and classic.

- **Burenwurst**: a coarsely ground, spicy sausage with a rustic feel.

- **Waldviertler**: a smoked and firmer sausage, often with a hint of garlic.

- **Debreziner**: a paprika-spiced sausage of Hungarian origin.

- **Bosna**: technically not Viennese but from Salzburg, a spicy sausage served in a white roll with mustard, onions, and curry powder. It is one of my personal favourites.

If you think all you have to do is pick your sausage, think again. Most sausages are grilled to order, and if the one you want is not ready, you might be told to wait or choose another. It is all part of the experience.

## Where to Go

There are over 170 sausage stands across Vienna, and many locals have their favorite. Here are a few to look out for:

- **Bitzinger am Albertinaplatz** – Perhaps the most famous, with its giant rooftop rabbit sculpture. The stand now also has a location at the Prater, adding more sausage to the amusement park experience. The rabbit, by the way, is a piece of contemporary art by sculptor Ottmar Hörl and has become something of a Vienna landmark.

- **Alles Wurscht** – The hipster twist on the classic. Champagne with your sausage? Vegan options? They have both.

- **Würstelstand LEO** – One of the oldest stands in the city, with loyal regulars. Classic, no-nonsense, and always busy.

- **Zum scharfen René** – Located on **Schwarzenbergplatz**, the "spicy" René lives up to its name with sausages that bite back. Not for the faint-hearted.

- **Würstelstand am Hohen Markt** – Right in the city center and open until 4 AM. A favourite final stop for partygoers emerging from the so-called Bermuda Triangle nightlife zone.

- **Hermann’s Würstelstand** – Tucked away in a garage just off Mariahilferstraße, this hidden gem is known for its authentic Bosna. Bonus: great ice cream is just a short walk away, but that’s a story for another time.
