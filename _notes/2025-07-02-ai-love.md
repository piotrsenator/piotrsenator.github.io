Twelve years ago, when I watched "Her" by Spike Jonze, I did not think AI relationships would become reality so soon. But here we are, an increasing number of people are falling in love with AI chatbots. Neuroscientists admit we still know little about this new form of love. But researchers in social cognition suggest that our brain’s chemistry (dopamine, oxytocin, and more) can respond to AI in much the same way as it does in human relationships. Even if the AI doesn’t "feel" anything, the human brain often reacts as if it does. 

The Beatles sung "Can't Buy Me Love" but while Replika app offers a “friend” for free, there are paid upgrades to unlock an AI “partner” or “spouse.” These idealized digital relationships, while comforting, may subtly reshape how we perceive communication, intimacy, and even conflict. EVA AI promotes itself with the tagline: “Chat with an AI Partner Who Appreciates You.” You do need to argue with a chatbot.

Just something to keep in mind, especially if ChatGPT is becoming your favorite conversation partner...
