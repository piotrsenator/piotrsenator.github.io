    <p>
My name is Piotr. I am an auditor, and I find it truly interesting to explore how public institutions operate and, at times, to understand why they do not quite meet expectations. I dedicate my efforts to comprehending the mechanics of large structures: how they achieve success, where they encounter difficulties, and the quiet adaptations they undergo over time.
    </p>
    <p>
My academic journey provided me with a strong combination of engineering and political science. This dual perspective often proves useful, enabling me to analyse problems by thinking across diverse systems and varying scales.
    </p>
    <p>
When I am not immersed in numbers and policies, I absolutely love to walk and cycle. Whether it is hiking up a mountain, discovering new corners of the world, or simply meandering through busy city streets, I embrace the chance to travel and explore. Having had the wonderful experience of living in several cities across Europe, I have become a firm believer in the European project.
    </p>
    <p>
On this page, I will be sharing some of my reflections, special memories from my travels, and a few practical tips from the cities where I have lived. I sincerely hope you find them both interesting and useful.
