I began my journey by taking the train to Wiener Neustadt, a small yet charming town with a cozy historic center. Outside the core, the town feels like a quiet Vienna suburb, offering a peaceful start to the trip. The Thermenradweg route here is well marked and forms an integral part of the broader EuroVelo cycling network, ensuring easy navigation for riders.

Leaving Wiener Neustadt, the path follows a picturesque canal, providing a scenic and mostly flat ride. Along the way, you pass just outside the spa towns of Bad Vöslau and Baden, both famous for their thermal baths, relaxing wellness centers, and elegant architecture. These towns offer tempting opportunities for a refreshing stop or a relaxing spa visit to recharge during your ride.

Continuing onward, the route takes you through the wine-growing region around Gumpoldskirchen. This area is a highlight for wine enthusiasts, with rolling vineyards stretching across the landscape. The town itself is picturesque, featuring traditional Heuriger wine taverns where you can sample local vintages alongside stunning views of the vineyards. Even for those less into wine, the scenic beauty of the vineyards and peaceful rural atmosphere make it an essential stop.

As the route approaches the southern outskirts of Vienna, the landscape begins to change. The industrial character of the area becomes apparent, contrasting with the natural beauty experienced earlier. Here, the trail climbs fairly steeply through green areas along the city boundary, providing a good workout and rewarding views.

The final stretch leads downhill into Vienna’s Favoriten district via Favoritenstraße, one of the city’s main thoroughfares. This section transitions you from rural tranquility into the bustling urban environment, completing the journey with a vivid contrast between peaceful countryside and vibrant city life.
