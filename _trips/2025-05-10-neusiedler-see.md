For a cycling trip around Neusiedl See, the most convenient way to begin is by taking the train from Vienna to Neusiedl am See. This charming town serves as a perfect gateway to the lake and the surrounding region. The cycling route around the lake forms a circular loop, but most riders prefer to travel clockwise, as the prevailing winds typically make this direction more comfortable and manageable. The entire trail is very well signposted, making navigation straightforward even for those unfamiliar with the area. Additionally, the route can be shortened by taking advantage of several ferry crossings that traverse the lake, allowing for flexible planning depending on your energy and time.

The landscape around Neusiedl See is notable for its extensive wetlands and shallow waters, creating a rich habitat that attracts a wide variety of bird species. As a result, you’ll often encounter passionate birdwatchers along the path, equipped with large telephoto lenses and spotting scopes. This region is internationally renowned as a hotspot for birdwatching, particularly during migration seasons, adding a natural and tranquil dimension to your ride.

One of the highlights along the route is Podersdorf am See, the town that comes closest to the water’s edge. Podersdorf has a distinctly seaside resort vibe, with sandy beaches, lively ice cream stands, and a laid-back summer holiday atmosphere that invites cyclists to pause and soak up the sun. It’s a perfect spot for a refreshing break, whether you want to dip your toes in the water or simply enjoy a cold treat.

Continuing onward, the trail leads you to Illmitz, a quaint town famous for its wine production. The surrounding vineyards and numerous wineries offer ample opportunities to sample local wines and experience the region’s rich viticultural heritage. The scenic beauty of the rolling vineyards adds a pleasing visual contrast to the lakeside wetlands.

As you near the border between Austria and Hungary, the quality of the cycling path slightly diminishes after crossing into Hungary. Here, the route diverges away from the lake and ascends through picturesque hills blanketed with vineyards, which brings some moderately challenging uphill sections. The change in terrain provides variety but also requires a bit more effort, rewarding cyclists with expansive views of the countryside.

Upon returning to Austria, the route descends sharply toward Moerbisch am See, a small town on the lakeshore. From there, you continue to Rust, a charming and historic town known as Austria’s stork capital due to its large population of nesting white storks. Rust’s picturesque streets, well-preserved architecture, and welcoming atmosphere make it an ideal place to explore or stop for a hearty meal after a day of cycling.

After your rest in Rust, you head back toward the train station. The final segment of the route passes through less dramatic landscapes, but this does not diminish the overall enjoyment of the journey. The entire loop offers a delightful mix of nature, culture, and cycling pleasure, making it one of Austria’s most popular cycling routes.
