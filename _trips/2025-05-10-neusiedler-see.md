For a cycling trip around Neusiedl See, the best way to start is by taking the train from Vienna to Neusiedl am See. The route around the lake is circular, but most cyclists prefer to go clockwise, as the prevailing winds tend to be more favorable that way. The entire trail is very well marked, and you can shorten the route by crossing the lake on one of several ferries.

Around the lake, you’ll find wetlands that attract many birdwatching enthusiasts equipped with large cameras. This region is famously popular for birdwatching. The closest point to the lake along the route is Podersdorf am See, which resembles a seaside resort with beaches, ice cream stands, and a relaxed holiday atmosphere. Continuing on, you’ll pass through Illmitz, a town well known for its numerous wineries.

As you approach the border, the quality of the route slightly decreases after crossing into Hungary. The trail moves away from the lake and climbs through picturesque hills covered with vineyards, which means some challenging uphill sections.

Returning to Austria, you descend sharply toward Moerbisch am See, then continue to the charming town of Rust—Austria’s stork capital. Rust is a delightful place to explore and a great spot to stop for a meal.

After your break, you head back toward the train station. The final stretch passes through less scenic terrain but doesn’t detract from the overall experience of this charming and well-loved cycling route—one of Austria’s most popular.
