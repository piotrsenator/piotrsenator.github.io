I set off from Vienna, following the Danube River for most of the journey. The route primarily runs along the flood protection embankment, which unfortunately means you don not always have uninterrupted views of the river itself. Because of this, I recommend making a detour near Orth an der Donau to get closer to the riverbank and take a leisurely lunch break. The local restaurant there is renowned for their specialties featuring carp prepared in a variety of different ways.

For dessert, I suggest cycling in the opposite direction toward the nearby castle. On the castle courtyard, a charming café awaits where you can enjoy a delicious pastry, an ideal way to relax and soak in the historic atmosphere.

Continuing onward, the route takes you to Hainburg an der Donau. From there, you can admire yet another castle perched majestically atop a hill, visible from a distance. Crossing a large bridge spanning the Danube, the trail gently ascends as you approach Bratislava. Approaching the city, you’ll first notice the characteristic blocks of communist-era apartments, a reminder of the region’s past, before the skyline of Bratislava itself emerges on the horizon.

The city’s renovated Old Town is perfect for a leisurely stroll. Its narrow streets, historic buildings, and vibrant squares invite exploration, while the imposing Bratislava Castle overlooking the city is an essential visit to appreciate both history and panoramic views.

From Bratislava, it’s possible to return to Vienna by train or boat, both offering scenic and convenient options. However, I chose to continue exploring further eastward, heading to the ancient Roman city of Carnuntum, located back in Austria. This archaeological park offers a fascinating glimpse into Roman life through reconstructed buildings, a museum, and ongoing excavations.

The ride then continues through open fields dotted with wind turbines—an unmistakable feature of this particularly windy region—leading toward Bruck an der Leitha. From there, it is easy to catch a train back to Vienna, concluding my cycling.
