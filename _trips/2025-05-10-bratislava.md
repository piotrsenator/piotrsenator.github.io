I set off from Vienna, following the Danube River for most of the way. The route mostly runs along the flood protection embankment, so unfortunately, you don’t always have a clear view of the river itself. For that reason, it’s worth detouring near Orth an der Donau to reach the riverbank and take a lunch break there. The local restaurants specialize in carp prepared in various delicious ways.For dessert, I recommend cycling in the opposite direction towards the castle, where you can enjoy a delicious pastry and coffee in a charming café on the castle courtyard.

Continuing onward, the route leads to Hainburg an der Donau, where you can admire another castle from a distance, perched high on a hill. Crossing a large bridge over the Danube, the path gently climbs as you approach Bratislava. From afar, you’ll first spot the typical communist-era apartment blocks before the skyline of Bratislava itself comes into view. The renovated Old Town is perfect for a stroll, and a visit to the beautiful castle is a must.

From Bratislava, you can return by train or boat. I decided to explore further, heading to the ancient Roman city of Carnuntum. After that, the ride continues along fields dotted with wind turbines—there’s a reason for their presence, as this area is notably windy, towards Bruck an der Leitha. From there, it is easy to take a train back to Vienna.
