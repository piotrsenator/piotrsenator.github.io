  <h1 class="page-title">Off the Trail</h1>
  <p>I spend a lot of time at a desk but whenever I can, I put on my hiking boots or hop on my bike. I enjoy heading out with friends just as much as walking alone, whether itâ€™s a quick escape nearby or a longer trip into the mountains. Here I have gathered a few outings that brought me real joy. Maybe they will inspire your next adventure.</p>
